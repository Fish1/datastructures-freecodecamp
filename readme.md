# ADT - Abstract data type

And abstraction of a data structure, or simply an interface for
interacting with a datastructure. Agnostic from the actual implementation.

List - dynamic array, linked list
Queue - link list, array, stack
Map - tree map, hash map
Vehicle - golf cart, bicycle, car, walking

# Complexity Analysis

How much time does this algorithm need to finish?

How much space does this algorithm need to finish?

## Big-O notation

Worst case performance. How does the algorithm perform when input size becomes arbitrarily large?

Constant: O(1)
Logarithmic: O(log(n))
Linear: O(n)
Linearithmic: O(n log(n))
Quadric: O(n^2)
Cubic: O(n^3)
Exponential: O(b^n), b > 1
Factorial: O(n!)
